# Dino-Jumping-Game
I created a Dino-Jumping Game for CS50 Problem Set 0 in December 2025, which is my first project that I have made with scratch: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1252013353 Have Fun!.
Player instructions:- 
0.  Start by clicking  on the "Green Flag" 
1.	Press Space to make the dinosaur jump.
2.	Avoid the diamond obstacles — if you hit a   diamond, the game ends.
3.	Each diamond you successfully pass increases your score by 1.
4.	The goal: get the highest score possible.
